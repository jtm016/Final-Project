# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Snakes and Ladders

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I will be recreating the game snakes and ladders. I will craete and do everyone on python, using turtle. I will be using turtle.onclick for different functions to work.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Using Python's turtle grahpic, I wil recreate snakes and ladders. My software will allow multiple players to play at the same time, as well as create a python turtle to visually spin the spinner to see how far each turtle(person) will go. Some features will be aldders, visual spinner and visual movements of the turtle to each square and extras. It will be executed through Python mainframe and turtle graphics as said earlier. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Rehan Choudry, tuq09096@temple.edu. His TA is Yang Zhao.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for this final project is a full working algorithm that will perform the game to its potential. I will accomplish create the board, making the turtle move, and implimenting the dictionary of values needed for Snakes and Ladders. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome is figuring out how to full create a full moving spinner in order to keeop moving up the game board. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outocme would be a full working game and create extra mini games in order for the user to move up the grid. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The steps needed would be to create the board and then the spinner. Using Turtle onclick will be very improtatnt since that is our interactive part with the user and the game. I will need to research turtle.onclock more throughly and possibly pygame in order to impliment the game with correct graphics. We will be splitting the work with each other, as one creates the idea and codes some, and the other works on how to work with onclick and impliment other ideas.
