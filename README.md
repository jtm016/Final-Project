My final project is the game Chutes and Ladders. Using Python Turtle Graphics, the seperate turtles create different items in the game. 
When running the game, you are asked to input the amount of players that are playing.
Based off the input, the amount of turtles is used.
In the grid you will see chutes (red triangles & lines) and ladders (green triangles & lines) 
The randomized button, when pressed, will give you the order of the players throughout the game. As the randomized button is pressed, the current text on the screen will dissapear. 
Context-Based messages, will appear and dissapear throughout the game to make it easier for the players. 
After the randomized button is pressed, the spinner will be available for use. The Spinner button will take the order of the players and the spinner button will display what color is being played.
The spinner button press is the only way the game progresses.
Use the spinner to continue the game until a winner is declared.
Once a player wins, the grid and turtles will dissapear and a message will pop up displaying which player won the game. 





NOTE: Only press the button once per each player and wait for that turn to finish before pressing again.
